Key operational practices for Ready-Mix dispatchers (adapted from internal coaching docs):

• Pre-pour readiness — Confirm the job ticket: correct mix, slump, quantity, access route, and job site conditions.
• Efficient loading — Target loading time under 7 minutes. Ensure ticket is signed and drum spins at a minimum of 4 rpm.
• En route tracking — Automatically send ETA alerts at 50% and 90% trip progress. Recalculate in heavy traffic.
• Water management — Watch for excessive water additions (>40L) that could alter concrete properties.
• Job site flow — Discharging should begin within 2 minutes of arrival. Escalate if waiting exceeds 10 minutes.
• Washing loop — Track washing time, fuel consumption, and any maintenance needs upon return to the plant.
• Performance loop — Review average cycle times daily, flag outliers, and track driver performance trends.

These practices help dispatchers reduce delays, improve product quality, and ensure operational efficiency.
